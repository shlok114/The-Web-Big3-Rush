# Day 1: HTML Revision

The Purpose is to Build core HTML fundamentals and clear understanding

## What does this Project Cover?
Almost everything about HTML
- Semantic layout (header, nav, section, article, aside, footer)
- Lists and tables
- Internal navigation with anchor links
- Form elements and input types

## Constraints
- no use of CSS
- no inline styles
- no layout hacks for design

## Learnings
- HTML only page DOES look ugly.
- HTML serves the sole purpose of *structuring* elements
- It is not built for design

```
